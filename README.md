In your project, require:

``` clojure
(require '[piotr-yuxuan.ephemeral-server :as ephemeral-server])
```

You now may open an ephemeral server that will live a short but
beautiful life âœ¨.

``` clojure
(let [port (atom nil]
  (with-open [_ (ephemeral-server/open port ["/ping" {:get (constantly {:body "expected"})}])]
    ;; Now @port is set to its actual value.
    (->> (http/get (format "http://localhost:%s/ping" @port))
         deref
         :body
         slurp)))
```
